# Hello There

I am Diksha Grover. I am currently working in an organization named "Crownstack Technologies". I am very happy with the work culture here. My mentor is cool and supportive. My colleagues are very good. It's great to work here. I learn everday in my company. I believe that here I can grow both as a professional and as a human being.

Right now I am learning git and github and after completing my training period I am looking forward to work on some great projects.
